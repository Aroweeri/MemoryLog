# MemoryLog
A basic leitner-style spaced repitition studying program. Written for the command line, this program allows a user to have reminders for when they need to review something on a day-to-day basis so that they can maximize the use of their studying time. Items can have an associated quiz that the user can take when that item appears in the list. The quizzes simulate a random flash-card deck that accepts text answers only.

Classes TestManager.java, Quiz.java, Question.java, and TestManagerLauncher.java belong to the quizletcopy package.
  
  -You will find in these classes code that allows the user to run through "flash cards" saved in files.

Classes MemoryLog.java, DateComparator.java, Item.java and OurDate.java belong to the memorylog package.
  
  -In these classes you will find code that allows the user to use the spaced repitition part of the software (particularly TestManager.java).
